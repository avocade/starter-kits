# Starter Kits

_Version 0.1_

## What

Executive summaries of all areas of human knowledge. 

## Rationale

Raise the level of new participants in an area of knowledge, and remove the *noob* factor.

## TODO

- Add some draft starter kits already been worked on
- Propose generic/template for new starter kits, to make contribution quicker and more formalized (milestone)
- Setup discourse.org forum (or Slack team) to debate new ideas or changes to existing structures; or simply do that fully within GitHub using issues and PRs
- Get first PR for a start kit, evaluate, and add to repo (milestone)
- Invite first committers to help scale
